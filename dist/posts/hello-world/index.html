It wasn&#39;t the code that held me up; that took a Sunday afternoon. The design wasn&#39;t the problem, nor the content.</p>
<p>Like most projects, the biggest delay was fear. Fear that my work would not be good enough. Fear that my skills weren&#39;t up to  the task. Fear that even though I&#39;m proud of this quick little blog site, it will be found wanting.</p>
<p>But that fear isn&#39;t a sustainable emotion. I should know; I&#39;ve been shipping artwork and code for four years professionally, much longer personally. That fear wrecks <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Analog mediums taught me a lot about that fear and its consequences. Charcoal, especially. When you work with charcoal you spend hours upon hours layering different types of burnt wood onto paper, slowly sculpting shapes and rendering forms in exquisite detail. Realism with charcoal becomes obsessive; you hone in onto the details of light and shadow in ways that most people never stop to notice.</p>
<p>But that perfectionism is dangerous. If you are too zealous with it, you burn your artwork. Burning means grinding the charcoal into the fibers of the paper so much that you cannot erase it - the pigment is stuck to the medium.</p>
<p>So twenty hours in, when you&#39;re obsessing over the way shadows are refracted in light and you think you&#39;re done but you&#39;re just not sure, you have to make a call. You have to decided whether or not you&#39;re done - because if you go further, you can burn the piece and ruin it.</p>
<p>You&#39;re never satisfied with the piece. Never. Satisfaction has nothing to do with it. What you need to decide is whether or not  you should risk destroying everything you&#39;ve built by attempting to make it better.</p>
<p>Sounds a lot like launching a product, shipping code, or submitting a design, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>That choice is probably the most painful part of the creative process, next to staring at a blank canvas. Its the most torturous feeling. To make something of quality, you must be a relentless perfectionist. To make something of quality that actually sees the light of day, you have to let go and just get it out there.</p>
<p>And people wonder why creatives love drinking.</p>
<p>In any case, this post is me, unsatisfied with my personal branding, unsatisfied with my code, unsatisfied with my writing,  putting this out there. </p>
<p>Hello, world.</p>
